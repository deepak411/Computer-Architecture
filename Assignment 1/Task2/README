1. There are four files source files included in this folder:


	cacheLinearRead.c

	cacheLinearWrite.c

	cacheRandomRead.c

	cacheRandomWrite.c



2. Use the alpha-dec-osf4-gcc "sourceFileName" -o "objectFile
" to build the object file

3. To change the arraysize for the files, edit the arr_size macro in the indiviual files. Comments have been added in the files appropriately.


4. Follow the simple scalar steps for the outputs as described in the assignment question.
5. use "-cache:il1 il1:1024:16:2:l -cache:il2 dl2 -cache:dl1 dl1:512:32:4:l -cache:dl2 ul2:256:64:16:l" for the provided configurations
 


6. Change the array size and repeat the process to observe the memory mountain plot.


7. The Cache data(hit ratio and other) is provided in the excel sheets provided in the folder "Table_SimpleScalar_Info".

8. NOTE: The lagre array sizes have not been included in the plots as the running time for those was vey high and could not be completed.
